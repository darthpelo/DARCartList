# DARCartList

The purpose of this project is to create a small app with **Swit 1.2** that does the following:

1. A list of products is retrieved from a REST endpoint
2. A View Controller presents the products in a grid (2 columns), items are roughly square shaped
3. Clicking on a product leads to another View Controller, showing this productâ€™s details
4. The details of the clicked product are retrieved from a REST endpoint as well based on a url which is derivable from the data in the product list response.
